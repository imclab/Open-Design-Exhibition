Storyboard Generator
====================

Here you can find the **Storyboard Generator**, just open the *index.html* file, copy the content of the *open.design_definition_storyboard.txt* file into the form, edit it, and then copy back the new content to the file. Then please save also the generated comic as a *.png* file (save a screenshot and then edit it) as *open.design_definition_storyboard.png*.

The **Storyboard Generator** is a slightly modified version of [Stripthis! 0.1](http://www.kesiev.com/stripthis/) an open source javascript library that transforms text into webcomics. For more information about the library and how to use it, check its own website.

Inside the *libs/stencils-community.js* file we can create a custom character for each of the participants in the community (but it is not necessary). Just copy one of the existing characters and edit it; have a look at the other .js files for inspiration and in the *cels* folder for the existing components you can use for building your character.
