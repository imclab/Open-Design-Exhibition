Meta
====

This is where you can learn how this process works: at the same time, it is open source, so you can access it, comment it with issues, discuss it on the mailing list, modify it when necessary and so on.
Three components define the process: the **storyboard** (that explains the story as a comic in an easy way), the **participation matrix** (that explains the whole process and how the participation is structured), the **activity design** (that explains the whole activity in more detail, including tools, rules, connections, and so on).

The process in the *meta* folder is built with the **Open P2P Design methodology**, an open source design methodology for co-designing open and collaborative processes. If you want to learn more about it, you can check [its website](http://www.openp2pdesign.org) or read [this short book](http://www.issuu.com/openp2pdesign/docs/openp2pdesign.org_1.1_english) that focuses more on the background context and [this toolkit](http://www.issuu.com/openp2pdesign/docs/openp2pdesign.toolkit_pixelache) that focuses more on designing with it.

Storyboard
----------

If you want to edit the storyboard, use the **Storyboard Generator** included in the folder. Just open the *index.html* file, copy the content of the *open.design_definition_storyboard.txt* file into the form, edit it, and then copy back the new content to the file. Then please save also the generated comic as a *.png* file (save a screenshot and then edit it) as *open.design_definition_storyboard.png*.

Process
-------

If you want to edit the file, please open the *.ods* file with [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/) / [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org/), edit it and save a *.png* file overwriting the *open.design_definition_participation.matrix.png* file (usually saving a *.pdf* file and then transforming it into an image works well).

Activity
--------

If you want to edit the file, please open the *.xmind* file with [XMind](http://www.xmind.net/), edit it, save it, and export it as a *.png* file overwriting the *open.design_definition_activity.design.png* file.
